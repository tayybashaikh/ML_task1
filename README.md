                                          # Elevate Lab Internship – ML Task 1

## Task Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and dataset understanding on *Students Performance Dataset*. Checked data types, missing values, and ML readiness.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.13, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook  

## Dataset
- StudentsPerformance.csv (from Kaggle)  
- Features: gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch, test preparation course, math/reading/writing scores  

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and inspected the dataset  
2. Checked missing values, statistical summaries, and unique values  
3. Visualized distributions and correlations  
4. Built a simple Linear Regression model to predict math scores  

## Observations
- Dataset is clean, suitable for ML  
- Scores positively correlated; regression model achieved good accuracy
